# About
I created this repository to improve my CSS skills and have fun at the same time. 

So far, I've made 6 draws in total. It was fun, and I've learned a lot (and been frustrated at times haha), but unfortunately this project has been discontinued.

## How to view the code underneath the beauty 
You can find [here](https://github.com/FireguiQueen/CSS-Arts/tree/main/Draws) the code for the designs.
